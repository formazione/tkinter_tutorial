    This one creates a GUI with buttons that opens links on the web or other stuffs,
    simply writing the text, the address and the png file for the button in an
    external file called sites.site and saving the png file in a folder called icons.
    Goal: make a nice GUI to reming you of sites and stuffs you're working on and to
    make it with less code
